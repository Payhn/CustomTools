1. Prompt the user to enter a MAC address.
2. Save the entered MAC address to a variable, let's call it 'user_mac'.

3. Initialize a boolean variable, e.g., 'continue_program', to True.

4. While 'continue_program' is True, do the following:
   a. Prompt the user to enter the last 2 octets of an IP address (assuming the first 2 octets are always '10.192.').
   b. Save the entered IP octets to a variable, let's call it 'ip_octets'.

   c. Read the SSH credentials (username and password) from a text file and store them in variables, e.g., 'ssh_username' and 'ssh_password'.

   d. Establish an SSH connection to the switch using 'ip_octets' and the SSH credentials.
      - You can use a Python library like Paramiko to handle the SSH connection.

   e. Send the command "show fdb" over the SSH connection to the switch.
   f. Capture the output of the "show fdb" command in a variable, let's call it 'switch_output'.

   g. Split 'switch_output' into lines to process each line separately.

   h. Loop through each line in 'switch_output':
      i. Check if the line contains 'user_mac'.
      ii. If a match is found, save that line to a variable, e.g., 'matching_line'.
      iii. If no match is found, continue to the next line.

   i. Close the SSH connection to the switch.

   j. Check if a 'matching_line' was found:
      i. If a match was found, display 'matching_line' to the user, indicating the switch port associated with the MAC address.
      ii. If no match was found, inform the user that the MAC address was not found in the switch's FDB.

   k. Ask the user if they want to continue checking another switch (Yes/No).
   l. If the user chooses "No," set 'continue_program' to False to exit the loop.

5. End the program.
