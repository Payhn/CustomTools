we need to optomize how the credentials file is created. I don't like saving it as a generic then uploading that to github. I would rather ignore my credentials file, and have my script create one if I don't have one already. I also want to hear about options to keep the credentials somewhat secure. I also want to have the credentials we reference in the same spot as the updates.py in the above folder so all the tools can use the same creds.
